Still today, high accuracy is mainly used in professional applications such as surveying, precision agriculture, civil engineering and geodesy, and is provided by the main GNSS augmentation service providers.

HAS provides civilian satellites with access to real time Precise Orbit Determination, without assistance from on ground systems, removing complexity in the spaceborne architecture and as a consequence in full alignment of the needs from New Space users. |  \nTable 1: Overview of the most relevant HAS target applications  \nCopyright © European Union Agency for the Space Programme, 2020-2025    6\nDocument subject to terms of use and disclaimers p. i",

The parameters and the business model of the service will foster innovation in both consolidated and emerging markets, notably in key areas such as drones and autonomous cars, minimising disruption in the current business models of established providers",

Galileo is a programme under civilian control and its services can be used for a broad range of applications. It is autonomous but also interoperable with existing satellite navigation systems.  \nOn 15 December 2016, the Declaration of Initial Services marked the beginning of Galileo's operational phase. This means that anyone with a Galileo-enabled device is now, in combination with other GNSS systems, able to use signals provided by Galileo's global satellite constellation for positioning, navigation and timing.  \nThe fully deployed Galileo system will provide the following high performance services worldwide:  \n• Open Service (OS) that targets the mass market. The OS offers either single (E1) or dual frequency (E1 and E5).",
