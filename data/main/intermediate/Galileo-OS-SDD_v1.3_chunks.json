Solar radiation is responsible for the ionisation producing free electrons and ions. The ionospheric refractive index (the ratio between the speed of propagation in the media and the speed of propagation in vacuum) is related to the number of free electrons through the propagation path. For this purpose, the Total Electron Content (TEC) is defined as the electron density in a cross-section (usually vertical) path between two points (i.e. satellite and receiver). TEC is measured in TEC units (TECU) where 1 TECU equals 10¹⁶ electrons/m². The ionosphere affects radio wave propagation in various ways such as refraction, absorption, polarization rotation, Faraday delay, time dispersion or scintillations. These effects are dispersive, as they depend on the signal frequency.",

The angular shift between satellites in two adjacent planes is 15 degrees. Satellites In service in these slots are referred to as nominal satellites.  \nThe constellation is complemented by auxiliary satellites that can be repositioned to any given slot in the same plane depending on maintenance or service evolution needs.  \nThe reference constellation geometry of the 24- slot Galileo constellation is defined in Table 1.

Additionally, as the time to receive clock corrections and ephemeris data is a major contribution to the Time To First Fix in many conditions, a reduction of this time supports in general all applications that require reception of this data from navigation signals. Please refer to the Galileo OS SIS ICD (Annex A [1]) for more information on all of the I/NAV features in this section.  \nThe Reduced Clock and Ephemeris Data (RedCED) and the Reed Solomon Forward Error Correction (RS FEC2) enable receivers to reduce the time to first fix (TTFF) by reducing the time to CED.",
