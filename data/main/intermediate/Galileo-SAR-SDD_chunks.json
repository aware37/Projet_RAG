How SAR/Galileo services are used by those conducting Search and Rescue operations remain their sole responsibility.  \nThe SAR/Galileo Full Operational Capability Service is European Union's contribution to the MEOSAR system through the operations of SAR Space Segment, Forward Link Ground Segment, and provision of Return Link Service.",

Its main functions are threefold:  \n• Tracking Schedule management: The MTCF is in charge of receiving and processing MEOSAR satellite orbital data through the MEOSAR GNSS Signal in Space ephemeris, almanacs, the SAR server or 3rd party Two Line Elements. On that basis, it implements an efficient algorithm to generate an optimised and coordinated SGS tracking plan that is disseminated to the three SAR/Galileo MEOLUT Facilities of the ECA (Maspalomas, Larnaca and Spitsbergen), taking advantage of the network configuration for optimal service performance and coverage. Moreover, the MTCF enables the addition of several external MEOLUTs in the tracking coordination process and for TOA/FOA exchange.",

The following list provides further per element details on the Galileo RLS robustness:  \n1. RLSP  \nThe current SAR/Galileo configuration includes a single RLSP infrastructure and site. Nonetheless high availability has been a design driver for the development of the RLSP resulting in a very reliable secure, modular, scalable, and virtualised infrastructure capable of sustaining single failures on the basis that a failure in one subsystem would not result in a failure of another subsystem. In this line, it should be highlighted that the RLSP architecture is not only robust to failures but also the data management preservation is built in.  \n2. Galileo Data Dissemination Network",

Galileo Ground Mission Segment  \nThe Ground Mission Segment (GMS) is the subsystem within the Galileo Core Infrastructure tasked with receiving the RLMR from RLSP and injecting the associated RLM into the allocated SAR fields in the Galileo signal in space. The GMS infrastructure is deployed in two different sites to ensure a high availability for all the Galileo services.  \n4. Galileo Space Segment  \nThe RLMs are uplinked to two separate Galileo spacecraft that are in-view of the target beacon.
