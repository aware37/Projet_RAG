Still today, high accuracy is mainly used in professional applications such as surveying, precision agriculture, civil engineering and geodesy, and is provided by the main GNSS augmentation service providers.

HAS provides civilian satellites with access to real time Precise Orbit Determination, without assistance from on ground systems, removing complexity in the spaceborne architecture and as a consequence in full alignment of the needs from New Space users. |  \nTable 1: Overview of the most relevant HAS target applications  \nCopyright © European Union Agency for the Space Programme, 2020-2025    6\nDocument subject to terms of use and disclaimers p. i",

The parameters and the business model of the service will foster innovation in both consolidated and emerging markets, notably in key areas such as drones and autonomous cars, minimising disruption in the current business models of established providers",

Galileo is a programme under civilian control and its services can be used for a broad range of applications. It is autonomous but also interoperable with existing satellite navigation systems.  \nOn 15 December 2016, the Declaration of Initial Services marked the beginning of Galileo's operational phase. This means that anyone with a Galileo-enabled device is now, in combination with other GNSS systems, able to use signals provided by Galileo's global satellite constellation for positioning, navigation and timing.  \nThe fully deployed Galileo system will provide the following high performance services worldwide:  \n• Open Service (OS) that targets the mass market. The OS offers either single (E1) or dual frequency (E1 and E5).",

Solar radiation is responsible for the ionisation producing free electrons and ions. The ionospheric refractive index (the ratio between the speed of propagation in the media and the speed of propagation in vacuum) is related to the number of free electrons through the propagation path. For this purpose, the Total Electron Content (TEC) is defined as the electron density in a cross-section (usually vertical) path between two points (i.e. satellite and receiver). TEC is measured in TEC units (TECU) where 1 TECU equals 10¹⁶ electrons/m². The ionosphere affects radio wave propagation in various ways such as refraction, absorption, polarization rotation, Faraday delay, time dispersion or scintillations. These effects are dispersive, as they depend on the signal frequency.",

The angular shift between satellites in two adjacent planes is 15 degrees. Satellites In service in these slots are referred to as nominal satellites.  \nThe constellation is complemented by auxiliary satellites that can be repositioned to any given slot in the same plane depending on maintenance or service evolution needs.  \nThe reference constellation geometry of the 24- slot Galileo constellation is defined in Table 1.

Additionally, as the time to receive clock corrections and ephemeris data is a major contribution to the Time To First Fix in many conditions, a reduction of this time supports in general all applications that require reception of this data from navigation signals. Please refer to the Galileo OS SIS ICD (Annex A [1]) for more information on all of the I/NAV features in this section.  \nThe Reduced Clock and Ephemeris Data (RedCED) and the Reed Solomon Forward Error Correction (RS FEC2) enable receivers to reduce the time to first fix (TTFF) by reducing the time to CED.",
